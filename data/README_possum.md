**Context**
Can you use your regression skills to predict the age of a possum, its head length, whether it is male or female? This classic practice regression dataset comes originally from the DAAG R package (datasets used in examples and exercises in the book Maindonald, J.H. and Braun, W.J. (2003, 2007, 2010) "Data Analysis and Graphics Using R"). This dataset is also used in the OpenIntro Statistics book chapter 8 *Introduction to linear regression*.

**Content**
From the DAAG R package: *"The possum data frame consists of nine morphometric measurements on each of 104 mountain brushtail possums, trapped at seven sites from Southern Victoria to central Queensland."*

A subset of the data was also put together for the OpenIntro Statistics book chapter 8 *Introduction to linear regression*.
